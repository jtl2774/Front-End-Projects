    <h3>About Me</h3>
    <p>Hi, nice to meet you! I'm Tracy - otherwise known for being a sensitive, creative, and imaginative soul. 
        If you were to bump into me on the sidewalk while passing by, you would usually find me doing one of three things: 
        listening to music, observing other people while listening to music, or just smiling at you as I pass by. :) I've earned 
        a reputation as a pretty individualistic person - I don't exactly take that with pride because it's hard to fit in sometimes but 
        that's ok, I've learned to accept it as is. I am great at listening to other people, but I am horrible at finding one activity to stick to.
        That's why every year I make it my goal to learn something new, travel someplace different, or change something about myself (whether that be 
        a really bad habit or just a new hairstyle). The possibilities are endless and I thrive on endeavoring into them!
    </p>
